## About This Repository

This is another repository that provides scripts for automatically building `rootfs.img` for the Xiaomi Pad 5 running Ubuntu.

This repository is based on **pi-gen**, the Raspberry Pi image building scripts.

I want to thank @TheMagicMojoMan for his generous help and his hard work on this device as well.

## How to Use

### Set up the build environment on Ubuntu 24.04

```
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt install -y debootstrap \
    qemu-user-static \
    arch-test gpg
wget http://ftp.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/a/android-platform-tools/mkbootimg_34.0.5-12_all.deb && \
    sudo dpkg -i mkbootimg_34.0.5-12_all.deb && \
    rm mkbootimg_34.0.5-12_all.deb
```

### (Optional) Create a `config` File

If you want to change the Ubuntu mirror or build a version other than **noble (24.04)**, create a file named `config` like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

# The version of Ubuntu to generate.  Successfully tested LTS: bionic, focal, jammy, noble
# See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames for details
TARGET_UBUNTU_VERSION="noble"

# The Ubuntu Mirror URL. It's better to change for faster download.
TARGET_UBUNTU_MIRROR="http://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/ubuntu-ports"
```

### Build the Image

```
sudo ./build.sh
```

After the build finishes, the image file will be located in:

```
work/ubuntu-noble-arm64/export-image/
```
